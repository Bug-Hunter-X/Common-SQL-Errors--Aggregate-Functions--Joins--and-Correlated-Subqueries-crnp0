This repository demonstrates common SQL errors and their solutions.  The `bug.sql` file contains examples of incorrect SQL code, such as using aggregate functions in WHERE clauses, ambiguous column names, and inefficient correlated subqueries. The `bugSolution.sql` file provides corrected versions of the SQL queries, highlighting the proper use of HAVING clauses, explicit JOIN syntax, and more efficient alternatives to correlated subqueries.
