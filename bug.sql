In SQL, a common error is incorrect usage of aggregate functions within the WHERE clause. Aggregate functions like SUM(), AVG(), COUNT(), MIN(), and MAX() operate on sets of rows, but the WHERE clause filters individual rows before aggregation.  Attempting to use an aggregate function directly in a WHERE clause results in a syntax error. For example:
```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE AVG(salary) > 50000;
```This is incorrect.  The correct approach would be to use a HAVING clause, which filters results after aggregation:
```sql
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM employees GROUP BY department HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
```Another example of subtle error is incorrect JOIN usage, particularly when dealing with multiple tables and ambiguous column names. If you have columns with the same name in different tables, you must explicitly specify the table name to avoid ambiguity.  Failure to do this can lead to unexpected results or errors.  For instance:
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders o JOIN customers c ON o.customer_id = c.id;
```is preferable to
```sql
SELECT * FROM orders, customers WHERE orders.customer_id = customers.id;
```The former (using explicit JOIN syntax) makes the join clearer and is less prone to errors compared to implicit join. 
Another potential issue is correlated subqueries, where the inner query depends on values from the outer query. Inefficiently written correlated subqueries can lead to performance problems.  Consider using joins instead of correlated subqueries when possible.
```sql
-- Inefficient Correlated Subquery
SELECT * FROM products p WHERE price > (SELECT AVG(price) FROM products WHERE category = p.category);
-- More efficient equivalent using JOIN
SELECT p.* FROM products p JOIN (SELECT category, AVG(price) AS avg_price FROM products GROUP BY category) AS avg_prices ON p.category = avg_prices.category AND p.price > avg_prices.avg_price; 
```
