The solutions are provided as comments within the `bug.sql` file itself.  See the corrected queries within the comments.  The essential fixes include using the HAVING clause in place of WHERE when filtering aggregated results, using explicit JOIN syntax instead of implicit joins, and rewriting correlated subqueries using JOINs for better performance. 
For instance, this incorrect query:
```sql
-- Incorrect: using AVG in WHERE
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE AVG(salary) > 50000; 
```is corrected to:
```sql
-- Correct: Using HAVING for aggregate filtering
SELECT department, AVG(salary) AS avg_salary FROM employees GROUP BY department HAVING AVG(salary) > 50000;
```Similarly, ambiguous joins are resolved using explicit JOIN syntax, and correlated subqueries are replaced by equivalent JOIN-based queries for improved efficiency.
